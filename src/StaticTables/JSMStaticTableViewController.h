/**
 * The `JSMStaticTableViewController` class creates a view controller object that manages a table view
 * using a `JSMStaticDataSource` as the data source for the table view. It's purpose it to implement
 * common behaviours and functionality so you don't have to do that yourself.
 *
 * Because I'm nice like that.
 *
 * It also conforms to the `JSMStaticDataSourceDelegate` protocol so that you can respond to messages
 * from the data source when necessary. It also implements some of the more useful delegate methods with
 * common implementations, including:
 *
 * - `dataSource:sectionNeedsReload:atIndex:`
 * - `dataSource:rowNeedsReload:atIndexPath:`
 *
 * Of course, these implementations can be overridden if desired.
